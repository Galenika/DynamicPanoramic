METHOD FOR INJECTION OF CUSTOM SCRIPTS INTO COUNTER STIKE: GLOBAL OFFENSIVE'S PANORAMA UI

Backstory:
 I quit csgo months ago, but when i saw the panorama ui i instanty got a massive hard on. I KNEW i had to make panorama my bitch, so i spent a while researching first i tried fucking from the outside, the code lay in a file called  "code.pbin", but was protected by some crypto and zip files that didnt work properly. I attempted to keep fucking from the front but it did not seem effective, so i decided i would fuck from behind, i grabbed panorama.dll and reversed out the zip utils from inside it, but soon learnt valves zip utils could not save the zip in the form nessissary for panorama to read. FINALLY i thought i would fuck it from the inside, i applyed a hook to panoramas parsing functions and injected my own files into the zip file, filling it to the brim with my own runny sticky code.
 
 Code and a real readme coming soon
